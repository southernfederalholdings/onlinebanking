# README
Here is the basic html structure for the bank i've been using. 
If you're interested in creating some alternative "themes" you can pull this and create a separate
css file in a folder like this: /themes/<yourtheme>/template.css 

At this time I am not looking to update the html, though i may work with the community to do this in the future. 

Your themes on separate branches will be reviewed by the community and may be used on stream so please only include code / images you have the rights to use and are able to give me (kitboga) the rights to broadcast and use. In other words, you need to be able to give me non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use whatever you contribute here.   

Thanks :)
